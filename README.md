# Reflect Upon Your Actions 

Built in 47h for the [Cambridge Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/camgamjam24) (theme: reflection).

> _Your mum has abandoned you in IKEA. All that is left is for you to reflect upon your actions..._
> 
> _Bored, you peruse the mirror lineup and create a little game. Use your head... and arms, and legs, to navigate the ball to the end of the maze. Pass the time until mum comes back._

- won most original game
- tied most popular game :)

## Development
Install `requirements.txt` with python 3.10, then run `main.py`. Currently seems incompatible with MacOS.
