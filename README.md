# Reflect Upon Your Actions 

Built in 47h for the [Cambridge Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/camgamjam24) (theme: reflection).

> _Your mum has abandoned you in IKEA. All that is left is for you to reflect upon your actions..._
> 
> _Bored, you peruse the mirror lineup and create a little game. Use your head... and arms, and legs, to navigate the ball to the end of the maze. Pass the time until mum comes back._

## To Play
Be sure to connect a webcam first :).
### Windows
Run the executable on [itch.io](https://dylanmoss.itch.io/reflect-upon-you-actions).
### Linux
```
# Optional: Create a venv first
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the game
cd src && python main.py
```


## Development
Install `requirements.txt` with python 3.10, then run `main.py`. Currently seems incompatible with MacOS.
